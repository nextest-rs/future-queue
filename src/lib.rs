#![warn(missing_docs)]

//! `future_queue` provides ways to run several futures:
//!
//! * concurrently
//! * in the order they're spawned
//! * with global limits
//! * and with an optional group specified for each future, with its own limits.
//!
//! This crate is part of the [nextest organization](https://github.com/nextest-rs) on GitHub, and is
//! designed to serve the needs of [cargo-nextest](https://nexte.st).
//!
//! # Motivation
//!
//! Async programming in Rust often uses an adaptor called
//! [`buffer_unordered`](https://docs.rs/futures/latest/futures/stream/trait.StreamExt.html#method.buffer_unordered):
//! this adaptor takes a stream of futures[^1], and executes all the futures limited to a maximum
//! amount of concurrency.
//!
//! * Futures are started in the order the stream returns them in.
//! * Once started, futures are polled simultaneously, and completed future outputs are returned
//!   in arbitrary order (hence the `unordered`).
//!
//! Common use cases for `buffer_unordered` include:
//!
//! * Sending network requests concurrently, but limiting the amount of concurrency to avoid
//!   overwhelming the remote server.
//! * Running tests with a tool like [cargo-nextest](https://nexte.st).
//!
//! `buffer_unordered` works well for many use cases. However, one issue with it is that it treats
//! all futures as equally taxing: there's no way to say that some futures consume more resources
//! than others, or that some subsets of futures should be mutually excluded from others.
//!
//! For nextest in particular, some tests can be much heavier than others, and fewer of those tests
//! should be run simultaneously. Also, some tests need to be mutually excluded from others, or
//! other concurrency limits placed on them.
//!
//! [^1]: This adaptor takes a stream of futures for maximum generality. In practice this is often
//!     an *iterator* of futures, converted over using
//!     [`stream::iter`](https://docs.rs/futures/latest/futures/stream/fn.iter.html).
//!
//! # About this crate
//!
//! This crate provides two adaptors on streams.
//!
//! ## 1. The `future_queue` adaptor
//!
//! The [`future_queue`](StreamExt::future_queue) adaptor can run several futures simultaneously,
//! limiting the concurrency to a maximum *weight*.
//!
//! Rather than taking a stream of futures, this adaptor takes a stream of `(usize, future)` pairs,
//! where the `usize` indicates the weight of each future. This adaptor will schedule and buffer
//! futures to be run until queueing the next future will exceed the maximum weight.
//!
//! * The maximum weight is never exceeded while futures are being run.
//! * If the weight of an individual future is greater than the maximum weight, its weight will be
//!   set to the maximum weight.
//!
//! Once all possible futures are scheduled, this adaptor will wait until some of the currently
//! executing futures complete, and the current weight of running futures drops below the maximum
//! weight, before scheduling new futures.
//!
//! The weight of a future can be zero, in which case it doesn't count towards the maximum weight.
//!
//! If all weights are 1, then `future_queue` is exactly the same as `buffer_unordered`.
//!
//! ### Examples
//!
//! ```rust
//! # futures::executor::block_on(async {
//! use futures::{channel::oneshot, stream, StreamExt as _};
//! use future_queue::{StreamExt as _};
//!
//! let (send_one, recv_one) = oneshot::channel();
//! let (send_two, recv_two) = oneshot::channel();
//!
//! let stream_of_futures = stream::iter(vec![(1, recv_one), (2, recv_two)]);
//! let mut queue = stream_of_futures.future_queue(10);
//!
//! send_two.send("hello")?;
//! assert_eq!(queue.next().await, Some(Ok("hello")));
//!
//! send_one.send("world")?;
//! assert_eq!(queue.next().await, Some(Ok("world")));
//!
//! assert_eq!(queue.next().await, None);
//! # Ok::<(), &'static str>(()) }).unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! ## 2. The `future_queue_grouped` adaptor
//!
//! The [`future_queue_grouped`](StreamExt::future_queue_grouped) adaptor is like `future_queue`,
//! except it is possible to specify an optional *group* for each future. Each group has a maximum
//! weight, and a future will only be scheduled if both the maximum weight and the group weight
//! aren't exceeded.
//!
//! The adaptor is as fair as possible under the given constraints: it will schedule futures in
//! the order they're returned by the stream, without doing any reordering based on weight. When
//! a future from a group completes, queued up futures in this group will be preferentially
//! scheduled before any other futures from the provided stream.
//!
//! Like with [`future_queue`](StreamExt::future_queue):
//!
//! * The maximum global and group weights is never exceeded while futures are being run.
//! * While accounting against global weights, if the weight of an individual future is greater than
//!   the maximum weight, its weight will be set to the maximum weight.
//! * *If a future belongs to a group:* While accounting against the group weight, if its weight is
//!   greater than the maximum group weight, its weight will be set to the maximum group weight.
//!
//! ### Examples
//!
//! ```rust
//! # futures::executor::block_on(async {
//! use futures::{channel::oneshot, stream, StreamExt as _};
//! use future_queue::{StreamExt as _};
//!
//! let (send_one, recv_one) = oneshot::channel();
//! let (send_two, recv_two) = oneshot::channel();
//!
//! let stream_of_futures = stream::iter(
//!     vec![
//!         (1, Some("group1"), recv_one),
//!         (2, None, recv_two),
//!     ],
//! );
//! let mut queue = stream_of_futures.future_queue_grouped(10, [("group1", 5)]);
//!
//! send_two.send("hello")?;
//! assert_eq!(queue.next().await, Some(Ok("hello")));
//!
//! send_one.send("world")?;
//! assert_eq!(queue.next().await, Some(Ok("world")));
//!
//! assert_eq!(queue.next().await, None);
//! # Ok::<(), &'static str>(()) }).unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! # Minimum supported Rust version (MSRV)
//!
//! The minimum supported Rust version is **Rust 1.56.**
//!
//! The MSRV will likely not change in the medium term, but while this crate is a pre-release
//! (0.x.x) it may have its MSRV bumped in a patch release. Once this crate has reached 1.x, any
//! MSRV bump will be accompanied with a new minor version.
//!
//! # Notes
//!
//! This crate used to be called `buffer-unordered-weighted`. It was renamed to `future-queue` to be
//! more descriptive about what the crate does rather than how it's implemented.
